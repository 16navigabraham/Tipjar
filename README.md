TipJar is a simple dApp that allows users to easily send ETH tips to creators by connecting their wallet. Built on WalletConnect and Ethereum, users can input a tip amount, send it securely on-chain, and optionally log the tip history using Firebase. It's a lightweight and gas-efficient way to support creators directly with crypto.
